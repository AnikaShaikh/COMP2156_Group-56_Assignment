Learning DevOps engineering is important in the software development cycle for several reasons. 
Firstly, it emphasizes the successful delivery of software that is entirely usable during every iteration, thereby increasing deployment success rates and shortening production cycles.
DevOps also fosters a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration, and experimentation, which supports change and innovation in the software development process.
Additionally, it encourages smoother communication, collaboration, integration, visibility, and transparency between development and operations teams, leading to faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing ones.
